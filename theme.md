# Theme

I'm generally going for a cyberpunk/futurist/hacker theme.

## Transparency

Avoid transparency. Each window should be self-contained, and
free of distractions.

## Colour

As far as possible, point everything back to colours set in the
terminal, following the ANSI pattern. Use "bright" colours for
details/decorations, and normal colours for blocks of colour.
